###Survey Comments
#####WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
- As always, it's nice to get visual representation of the learning material. So going over things in Atom/Terminal is great over just lecturing about it.

- Git and GitHub

- Everything is hands on and Scott and the TA's are fantastic!

####WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
- I wish less class time was spent on topics that were already covered in the Javascript CodeAcademy course. I feel like we are redoing a lot of stuff that everyone should already be familiar with and makes the class less interesting/engaging

- Sometimes the textbook reading can be kind of bland. I find class and demo time more efficient and worthwhile.

- Since its just the first week, I think the labs feel a little unnecessary as I find myself staying for only an hour or so to finish homework that I could also just finish at home. not sure if its been worth making the drive out to Seattle to work in a quiet space. I'm sure when we get a little deeper into the class, having the instructor and TA's available will be handy.

####DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?
- Website program description does not include the fact that there are labs twice a week that are not on normal training days. Would be worth mentioning on the website instead of letting the class know on the first day.

- The only thing is that I was unaware of the pre-class canvas assignments. This was because the Canvas invite was in my inbox but since I had never heard of Canvas I assumed it was just junk mail. It would have been nice to know about it so that I didn't start the class already behind on the readings and intro stuff. I may have been the only one though, so it might have been me not paying attention to other emails that explained this.

- It may be nice to have TAs be more interactive during lecture. Scott is tied up giving the lecture and sometimes if I'm stuck, I'm afraid to interrupt him (and the class). If the TAs are there to walk around and make sure we are all on the same page, that would minimize students falling behind and/or feel bad about asking for help/disrupting the class.
