##Quick review of data types:
*The most common types are:*

- Numbers
  - Float: a number, like 1.21323, 4, -33.5, 100004 or 0.123
  - Integer: a number like 1, 12, -33, 140 but not 1.233
- String: a line of text like "boat", "elephant" or "damn, you are tall!"
- Boolean: either true or false, but nothing else
- Arrays: a collection of values like: 1,2,3,4,'I am bored now'
- Objects: a representation of a more complex object

*Coercion*
- At times we will want to force one data type to another data type
  - e.g. A string value to a number value.
  - In this example, we would want to use `parseInt('10')` to get the number `10` in return
