# Supporting Information
### Tool Belt
If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away in lab. **Note**: Students using Linux or Windows should coordinate with the TA or Instructor who is the most experienced with those platforms (We will help identify those people).

### Design
Design a script (**without actually writing any code yet!**) for a simple "Hello, World" app.

For all local file manipulation, use the Terminal and the Unix commands that you learned in class today.

Next, create a file called index.html that has all of the primary components of an HTML document in the proper structure and order: 'body', 'doctype', 'head', 'html', and 'title'.

Do by hand as a flowchart on a piece of paper (think of paper as a little personal whiteboard... what a concept!). You'll need these design for the rest of the lab assignment.

### HTML content!
Add a new file to your folder called index.html (do this from the terminal) and create the basic HTML structure for this page using your basic building block elements (doctype, html, head, body, script, etc).

Once the framework is in place, add new elements and content to your page for the following areas of information about you:

- Name
- Biography
- List of Experience
- List of Education
- List of Goals

Think about how readable your code is to other programmers. Be attentive to code style and conventions, as much as you know of them them at this point.

### JavaScript!
Like we did we did in class, write JavaScript inside of script tags (placed at the bottom (inside) of the body), that does the following:

- Receives user input through a prompt that asks “What is your name?” and stores that input into a variable
- Returns an 'alert' box with a message that contains that user name somewhere in the middle (“Good to meet you, Homer, enjoy your doughnuts!” or the like)
- Adapt the message to something different than what we did in class

### GitHub Gists
Gist is powered by the Ace editor, which supports syntax highlighting, indentation awareness, multiple cursors, and many more features. You can also drag and drop a file of code from your desktop directly into the gist editor.

If you are signed in to GitHub when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to [your gist home page](https://gist.github.com/).

- The name of your Gist file should be `index.html` (the file extension `.html` will cause Gist to highlight your code with colored syntax).
- Type an optional description and name for your gist.
- Type the text of your gist (paste your code from Atom) into the gist text box.
- To create a secret gist that is not searchable by other users, click Create secret Gist.

Finally, copy the URL (internet address) to your Gist, and past into the Canvas assignment for submission.
