##WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
Paired programming went really well this week. I learned a lot from looking at my partners' codes. Shows how other people code, debug and brainstorm ideas! Loved it!!!

Enjoyed the pair programming sessions. Was able to work out some issues I was having by working with others. Nice!

I enjoy the fact that Scott and the TA's are available for us at anytime during class or labs.

I found pair programming to be especially helpful this week. It's productive to learn how collaboration and development coincide from the beginning of our training.

All the resources we are given for information. Knowing we don't just have to memorize everything!

Lab time was helpful.

Get our homework graded quicker so I know what I can improve on for the next homework assignment. So far our assignments are built to add on to our previous assignments. So it's a little hard if we want to work on the next assignment but not sure if our current code is okay.

Reading others code at the start of class can be a little monotonous. Especially when the student is using code that the the class has not been taught yet making it a little bit of an "over the head" experience. After a while it just seems like the person reading the code is just droning on. I'm sure its a good learning tool to read others code out loud but it can be a little dry.

Nothing is not helpful. Sometimes the class moves pretty fast, but I feel I can always ask for help.

I'd like more feedback on my code -- we've submitted a number of pull requests and I'd like to know how I'm coming along and where I can push myself, etc.


##DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?
Please grade assignments so we can have feedback on our work!

Scott does lots of things in the developer console in the browser and it is great to see them live, but it would be great if they could somehow also be added into the class code js file somehow.
