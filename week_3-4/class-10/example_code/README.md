#Survey Responses
None. All were helpful. (Scott's observation: Lots of these comments)

The all day lab Sunday was very helpful. It is nice to have people around if I need help, and to be able to zone out if I don't.  (Scott's observation: Lots of these comments)

I like when Scott reads the code during code review, it just makes it easier to understand. I also really really liked the extra lab time on Sunday, I think a lot of us were falling behind on reading and it was nice to take a breath and catch up. (Scott's observation: Lots of these comments)

In addition to normal code reviews, it would be great to see the 'best practice' or 'ideal' way of implementing a particular function so that we can learn about the most efficient or most effective way to do things

It would be helpful to see more examples of code. I feel like the assignment seems pretty straight forward and almost as if there is one way to do it. It's great to see other peoples code but maybe more examples of "bad code" so I know what to steer clear of.


Overall this week has been pretty helpful as we're starting to explore code that applies directly to a professional website that has a business side to it.

In the 3rd week and with the new project, I like how Scott gave stricter parameters for the project. When we do code review it helps things fall into place easier when looking at other people's code and it correlates to what we talked about in class. Object literals also seem pretty fun and I'm excited about working with more arrays.
