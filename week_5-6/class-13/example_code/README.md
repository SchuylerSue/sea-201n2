#WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
The live coding was great to see. With so many new CSS selectors and styling options it was great to see examples live.

I thought Scott showing us the Skeleton and 960gs stylesheets was a handy tool that we can use in the future outside of Code Fellows.

Working with the DOM and CSS, while frustrating at times, was really helpful and being able to create an html page that looks a bit more professional and less like a PowerPoint slide makes me feel like i'm progressing as a developer.

I enjoy having time to work on projects in lab. It's cool to have Scott and the TAs available to help while coding.

Lab has been the most helpful. I usually leave lab with a better understanding of what we're learning. Great job TAs!! Lecture has been good too and I like going over my peers' examples during class.

I like that Scott is doing the code reviews; it goes faster and is an easier flow to follow. I see how it is beneficial to have us read the code sometimes, but for the sake of the entire class, I think it's better when Scott goes through it.

Lab is always the most helpful along with live coding and code review.

Confused by listener events and how they work, v. thankful we got a second lecture on them.


#WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?
The reading this week felt a little outdated. It seems like the current state of HTML5 and CSS is beyond what is taught in the book. I would have rather read something a little more current.

Tables were fairly simple and probably could have been covered when we first did lists.

Second week of cookie shop starting to feel slow. Not learning as much anymore Code review has become really tedious and takes a really long time. Might be good to pick examples of good or bad pieces of code to review rather than everything.

I wish we would have learned how to create and implement wireframes before we dove into CSS. I guess, if anything, the lack of process and structure around CSS taught me that I need to define/refine what works for me. Going into writing CSS blind certainly doesn't work for me.

The TAs don't ever seem to remember how to do proper Javascript. They all say, "I know how to do that in JQuery but..." This isn't amazingly helpful but at least they will try and talk it through. Usually the explanation they hit on is kind of different from Scott's and that has caused some dead ends this past week. Not really sure this can be improved, just want to get to JQuery myself...


#DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?
Having us create a home page and struggle with layout before showing us skeleton and flex box was kinda cruel

While I appreciate Scott's candor around being apprehensive toward CSS, I find that he isn't taking the opportunity to be an example of how to "dislike" a language and work your way through it. There's naturally going to be aspects of the work that we're not drawn to, maybe even outright dislike, but I want to be shown how to implement a process that will at least keep me focused and efficient. Style-guides seem important, but it felt like that task was out of order with the rest of the design/CSS process. Wireframe > Visual Design/Mock-up > HTML & CSS > Style-Guide for future work/developers, no?

Can we please get the readings up ASAP? If I am busy at work during the day there is really no time in the week for me to do them other than Saturdays (unless I do them in labs.) I'd like to put Saturdays aside to do all the week's readings in one go but usually they aren't even up. Doesn't matter immediately since I am so behind on the readings, but I'd like to change that!
